# CheesePad
CheesePad is a "D-Pad" for PCs meant to be controlled by your mouse cursor.
## How It Works
Basically when the program runs, it will display a small, fix-sized, transparent window with arrow keys in every direction.  Hover your mouse over an arrow to simulate key-events in that direction.  I hope to add functionality for clicks and double-clicks soon.
